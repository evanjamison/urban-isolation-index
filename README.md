## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates applied skills in:

- Geospatial analytics (GeoPandas, PySAL)  
- Urban social science and aging studies  
- Statistical modeling + feature engineering  
- Unsupervised learning (PCA)  
- Spatial inference (Moran’s I, LISA)  
- Data pipeline design and visualization  

The approach is highly relevant to programs such as:  
**Hitotsubashi University – School of Social and Data Science**,  
urban policy research, public health analytics, and computational social science.
